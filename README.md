# My solutions to exercises in HtDP second edition.

`lasciate speranza voi ch'entrate`

This repo is an atrocious mess, so if you have come here looking for help as you work your own way through the book, enter at your own risk!

I have not completed all of the exercises, and I probably won't (I got pretty tired of making games), but I hope to update this regularly as I keep making a modicum of progress through the book.

## Notes
* skipping section 16.8 (exercises 275, 276, 277, 278). not sure if I'll return to do any of those exercises
