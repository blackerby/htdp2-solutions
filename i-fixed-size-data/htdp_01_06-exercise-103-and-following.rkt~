; Space is a Number(0,100]
; interpretation: the amount of space in square feet an animal needs
; in case of transport

(define-struct spider [legs space])
; A Spider is a structure:
;   (make-spider Number(0,8] Space)
; interpretation: (make-spider legs space) describes a spider
; where legs denotes number of remaining legs and space denotes
; amount of space needed in case of transport

(define-struct elephant [space])
; An Elephant is a structure:
;   (make-elephant Space)
; interpretation: (make-elephant space) describes an elephant
; where space denotes amount of space need in case of transport

(define-struct boa [length girth space])
; A Boa is a structure:
;   (make-boa NonnegativeNumber NonnegativeNumber Space)
; interpretation: (make-boa length girth space) describes
; a boa constrictor where length is its length, girth is its
; girth, and space is the space needed for transport

(define-struct armadillo [length shell space])
; An Armadillo is a structure:
;   (make-armadillo NonnegativeNumber NonnegativeNumber Space)
; interpretation: (make-boa length shell space) describes
; an armadillo where length is how long it is from nose to tail tip,
; shell is the strength of its shell, and space is the space needed
; to transport it.

; A ZooAnimal is one of:
; - Spider
; - Elephant
; - Boa
; - Armadillo
; interpretation: a zoo animal whose attributes are specified according
; to the types described above
; examples:
(make-spider 7 10)
(make-elephant 80)
(make-boa 20 5 20)
(make-armadillo 5 10 9)

(define-struct cage [length width])
; A Cage is a struct:
;   (make-cage NonnegativeNumber NonnegativeNumber)
; interpretation: a cage for animal transport where length is its length and width is its width
; examples:
; - (make-cage 10 10)
; - (make-cage 5 11)

; returns #true if the space of the ZooAnimal is less than
